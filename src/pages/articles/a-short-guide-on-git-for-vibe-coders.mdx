## Before we begin
This isn’t a hands-on git tutorial. If you want commands, go read <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial" target="_blank">Git’s official documentation</a> or try <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a>.

This guide is for people who build by feel. You’re not memorizing flags or syntax; you’re here to understand **how git works**, so your projects don’t get nuked when your editor crashes.

## When do you actually need Git?
If you’re coding inside <a href="https://bolt.new" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://lovable.dev" target="_blank">Lovable</a>, or <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a> - you don’t.

Those tools give you version control for free. You only need Git when you graduate to <a href="https://cursor.com" target="_blank">Cursor</a> or <a href="https://windsurf.com" target="_blank">Windsurf</a>. That’s when the training wheels come off.

The AI will run the commands for you. What you need to understand is **why** and **when** to use Git.

---

## Git vs GitHub
- **Git** is local. It tracks changes to your code. Think of it as a personal time machine.
- **GitHub** is remote. It backs up your snapshots to the cloud.

Git saves your project history. GitHub saves your Git history.

---

## What actually happens when you "init Git"
You walk into a folder, ask your AI "is git initialized here?", and if it isn’t, you say "start it."

This creates a hidden `.git` folder and sets your current branch to `main`. That’s the default timeline of your project.

## Untracked → Staged → Committed
This is the lifecycle of a file in Git.

1. **Untracked** – Git doesn’t know this file exists.
2. **Staged** – You tell Git “I want to include this in my next save point.”
3. **Committed** – You save the snapshot.

Modified files go through the same process. Git doesn’t care if it’s new or edited, it just tracks state transitions.

---

## GitHub is just your offsite backup
You create a repo on GitHub. You copy the HTTPS link. You set that link as your remote.

From that point on, you can push your local snapshots to the cloud. That’s it.

## The power of branching
This is where Git becomes a cheat code.

You don’t need to commit to one timeline. You can branch off, explore an idea, and merge it back later.

Use branches when:
- You’re building a risky feature
- You need to fix an issue on the live environment
- You want to test alternatives without wrecking main

---

## Merge conflicts: when timelines collide
Let’s say two branches change the same line. Git doesn’t guess.

When you merge, Git shows you the conflict and makes you pick. You either:
- Keep A
- Keep B
- Merge both manually

That’s it. It’s not magic. It’s version negotiation.

---

## What matters is **why**, not **how**
You don’t need to remember commands. Let your AI editor handle them.

Just understand:
- Git is for **saving states**
- GitHub is for **backing them up**
- Branches let you **experiment without risk**
- Conflicts are **manual decisions**

That’s enough to build without fear.

Now go break things. You’ve got a time machine.

Until next time, happy vibe coding.
