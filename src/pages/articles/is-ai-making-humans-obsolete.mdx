## TL;DR
No, AI is not going to make humans obsolete. It is going to make humans more productive and efficient.

## Long Version
Unless you are completely disconnected from the internet, you may have heard about Open AI and their achievements in creating one of the best [LLM (Large Language Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models) a.k.a [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/).
Not only has this tool made them the fastest growing company (in terms of user base) on the internet,
but it has also set the stage for the next big tech revolution.
In fact, it's so good that it has created an existential crisis for many people and raised a wave of fear among them that
AI is coming for their jobs. Not going to lie, I am one of those people who have been asking this question myself for some time now
as well. That is why I have decided to write this article to give my perspective on this from the point of view of a Software
engineer and a person who is really interested in AI for quite some time now and understands its limitations.

Before we discuss whether this new wave of AI revolution is going to make humans obsolete, let me paint the picture of how good Chat GPT is, for you.

## Chat GPT
Chat GPT is a really capable generative AI. If you can create a good enough prompt, you can instruct Chat GPT to provide you with almost any piece of information. The current cut-off for the data set GPT-4 has been trained on is September 2021. You can ask it any question and it will answer. You can ask it to write you a piece of software and with a bit of help, self-reflection, and context it will do a very good job.
Furthermore, it has now been supercharged by the addition of a plugin ecosystem to provide it with latest context and more. Please watch the video below to understand how crucial this plugin ecosystem is going to be.

All in all, CHAT GPT is a really powerful tool, and it is going to be a game changer for the tech industry. In fact, we can see it happening right in-front of our eyes.
It has opened a flood gate of new utilities that people are implementing every day.

## Conclusion
AI is here, it's improving every day, and it's going to make humans more productive and efficient.
Instead of fearing it, we should embrace it and use it to our advantage.
We should augment ourselves with it and use it to make our lives better and more productive.
