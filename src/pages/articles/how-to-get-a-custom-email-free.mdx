Want a professional-looking email address without paying for Google Workspace? This step-by-step tutorial shows you how to create a custom domain email address and link it to your Gmail inbox—completely free.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A custom domain name
- A Gmail account
- A Cloudflare account

## Step 1: Link Cloudflare to Your Custom Domain
After signing in to Cloudflare, click the "+ Add a Site" button in the top-left corner of the dashboard.

Follow the instructions:
- Enter your domain name
- Choose "Quick scan for DNS records"
- Click "Continue"

Select the **Free** plan on the next screen and click **"Continue."**

You’ll see a list of DNS records. Leave them unchanged—removing records may break your service. Just click **"Continue to activation."**

In Step 3, you’ll be provided with two new nameservers.

Go to your domain registrar (like Namecheap or GoDaddy), locate the nameservers section, select **Custom Nameservers**, and paste in the two nameservers.

Your records should look something like this:

The above shows the Namecheap panel for the domain "anfalmushtaq.com."

Return to Cloudflare and click **"Continue"** to complete setup. Nameserver propagation may take a few minutes to a few hours.

Once active, your domain will show as "active" on the Cloudflare dashboard:

## Step 2: Enable Email Routing in Cloudflare
Inside your Cloudflare dashboard, select your domain and click **"Email"** from the left sidebar.

Enable the email routing feature. Once active, you’ll be able to:

1. Navigate to **Destination addresses** and enter your Gmail address.
2. Go to **Routing rules** to create email aliases.

This lets you forward emails sent to addresses like `hello@yourdomain.com` to your personal Gmail inbox.

Congrats! You’ve created a custom email address that forwards directly to Gmail.

## Step 3: Send Emails from Gmail Using Your Custom Address
To send emails *from* your new address, you need to set up an alias in Gmail.

### Create an App Password (for Gmail with 2FA)
If your Google account has 2-factor authentication enabled, create an app password <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords" target="_blank">here</a>:

- Click "Create app password"
- Name it something like "Domain Email Password"
- Click "Create" and copy the password somewhere secure

### Add Alias in Gmail
Go to your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/accounts" target="_blank">Gmail settings</a>. In the **"Send mail as:"** section, click **"Add another email address."**

<BlogImage src="blog/2025-04-02-how-to-get-a-custom-email-free/alias-popup.png" alt="Alias Popup" />

Enter your custom email (e.g., `hello@yourdomain.com`) and click **"Next Step."** Then input:

- **SMTP server**: `smtp.gmail.com`
- **Port**: `587`
- **Username**: your Gmail address
- **Password**: the app password (if 2FA is enabled) or your regular Gmail password

Click **"Add Account."**

You're all set! You can now send emails from Gmail using your new custom address.

## What’s Next?
With your custom email up and running, consider creating Gmail filters to organize incoming emails into folders automatically.

Fun fact: This is exactly how I manage `hello@anfalmushtaq.com`.

## Gotchas
This method only gives you email *forwarding* and *sending* capabilities—it doesn’t include extras like Google Drive or Calendar. If you’re okay skipping Google Workspace’s extra features, this is a perfect free solution.

Evaluate based on your needs. For most individuals and early-stage startups, this is more than enough!
