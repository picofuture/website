## Context
I have had a very difficult time figuring out the nitty-gritty details of startups and I want to save your time by relaying my knowledge to you. Here is a step-by-step list of creating a startup that I would follow if I had to create one.

## Prepare For The Startup World In Steps

### Step 1: Read / Listen To The Following Books
1. [Atomic Habits](https://www.audible.ca/pd/Atomic-Habits-Audiobook/B07GBGQJSW). Learn how to build habits. It is extremely important because startups are not easy and consistency is everything.
2. [Essentialism](https://www.audible.ca/pd/Essentialism-Audiobook/B072591XFD). Learn the importance of focusing on what's important and blocking the noise. Extremely important since startups require the art of solving the correct problem.
3. [Deep Work](https://www.audible.ca/pd/Deep-Work-Audiobook/B071HFRS4S). Learn the importance of going deep. It's the only way to succeed and distinguish yourself, so don't miss it.
4. [The Mom Test](https://www.audible.ca/pd/The-Mom-Test-Audiobook/B07RJZL5KK). Extremely important to understand how to validate your idea or find a problem. Don't miss it.

### Optional Books
1. [The Top 5 Regrets Of The Dying](https://www.audible.ca/pd/The-Top-Five-Regrets-of-the-Dying-Audiobook/B075Y2TPNN).
2. [$100 Startup](https://www.audible.ca/pd/The-100-Startup-Audiobook/B071F15R8S).

### Step 2: Understand The Building Blocks Of Startup Founders
You don't have to be the master of all these qualities but if you can master 2 or 3, they will catapult you forward in the competition, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK_XwjhJl3k).

1. Engineering
2. Product -> [Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-manager-nanodegree--nd036) **(paid)**.
3. Design
4. Sales & Marketing
5. Finance
6. Management & Leadership

### Step 3: Build The Mindset
Go through [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org), free resource by [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) to build a startup driven mindset.

## Startup In Steps
Please go through the resources in **Prepare For The Startup World In Steps** before continuing forward.

### Step 1: Build Your Audience
This an important step so don't ignore it. The best product in the world is of no use if there is no one to use it. The mom test will definitely get you your first customers, and you will be able to scale outwards from there but having an active audience always give you an edge. Read this [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/mpdvq6/i_built_a_50k_following_in_9_months_and_it/) to get more insight on how you can build engaging audience on Twitter. The most important thing is you provide value to the world. What you'll provide will never go to waste and will always be reciprocated.

### Step 2: Problem Identification / Validation
You need to figure out a problem. If you have gone through the resource above, you will know that first you have to figure out a problem in the real world. Once you have figured out the problem, you can apply the mom test to figure out if the problem is actually something you should be solving. You can also use the mom test to find the problem. I will suggest reading up on this [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mmwphz/how_stripe_validates_ideas_for_new_products/) and this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1376033582305615873) on how to validate and prioritize the features in the product.

### Step 3: Build The MVP
Alright, so now you know what to build. Let's talk about the MVP, an MVP has to follow 2 rules. It should ideally be under a $100, and [it should not take over a month to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn5QxET8Y8c). My advice would be to go for simplicity. Use no code tools, existing services, and Google sheets to build an MVP ASAP. Don't worry about automations and if you have to do manual work, don't be afraid of it. If you have to get the money from the user, use your PayPal/Venmo address. Remember, if your product is good enough and people really want it, they will do whatever they can to get it so don't worry about not looking like a billion-dollar company on day 1.

### Step 4: Get your first 10 customers
If you applied the mom test successfully then you should have your first eager customers. They can be your friends, you, or the people you talked to. Give them access to the MVP, stay in close contact with them and iterate over your product as quickly as possible to move towards the product your customers want.

### Step 5: Scale Up As Much As You Can
Keep on iterating over your product and scale up as much as you can. This will not only help you grow your customer base but will also help you in raising investments and getting in the incubator/accelerator.

### Step 6: Join The Incubator
The investors in the incubators are not only investing in you but are also mentoring you to be the best. If you feel like you are sufficient and don't need this then by all means ignore this step.

### Step 7: Raise The Investments
After you graduate from the incubator or if you skipped the incubation step, you should be able to raise the investments for your business.
