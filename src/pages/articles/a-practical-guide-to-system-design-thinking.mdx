## Not Your Traditional System Design Blog
I'll be honest - there are tons of system design resources out there. That's not what we're doing today.
Instead, I want to share how I think about system design - the mental model I've developed from building startups from scratch and scaling systems at enterprises.

Don't worry, it's not just theory. I've included detailed resources from an actual system design case study that I recently did to show these principles in action.

## A Quick Disclaimer
Rather than preaching a fixed method, I want to encourage critical thinking. I'm constantly evolving my approach, and I hope you'll do the same.
Take my methods with a grain of salt, understand them, and improve upon them.
If you discover something interesting along the way, shoot me an email at hello@anfalmushtaq.com. Let's keep this fountain of knowledge flowing.

## Setting the Stage
Before we dive in, let's get one thing straight: technology decisions should always follow stakeholder needs, not lead them.
Yes, you'll drive the technical choices, but they should be rooted in actual problems we're trying to solve.

Let's see this approach in action by designing a real system.

## Define the Problem
Let's start with our goal: design a sales forecasting system that helps customers see their sales forecast on weekly, monthly, and yearly bases. The service needs to be highly available, accurate, and consistent.

That's it - that's all we know. I've intentionally kept this vague to show you how to approach system design when requirements aren't crystal clear.

## Starting with Why
Before jumping into how to build it, let's ask the most important question: why do our stakeholders need this? We're qualified enough to design this system, so we should be critical enough to validate its value.

Here's a principle I always remember: If you asked a businessman 100 years ago what they wanted, they'd probably say "a faster horse." As problem solvers, it's our job to recognize that what they really need is a car.

For our sales forecasting system, here's why it matters:
- Help businesses forecast future sales
- Enable understanding of customer spending patterns
- Support informed inventory decisions
- Guide budget planning based on predicted revenue

## Technical Analysis
Let's get specific about what we're building. This isn't theoretical - in a real scenario, these numbers would come from your company's data. For now, I'm making informed assumptions.

We're looking at:
- A time-series ML model resistant to overfitting and vanishing gradients
- ~250 million daily records (I'll share the napkin math shortly)
- 7 years of data retention for compliance
- High availability with strong consistency (yes, we'll tackle the CAP theorem trade-offs)
- 7% YoY growth, leading to terabytes of data

All of this will run on AWS - not because it's the only choice, but because it offers the complete solution we need for this case study.

## Requirements Breakdown
Let's break this into clear, actionable requirements. I'm dividing these into functional and non-functional requirements because these will drive our technical decisions.

### Functional Requirements
Straightforward stuff - our system needs to:
- Show sales predictions by product category
- Support different time frames (week/month/year)

### Non-functional Requirements
Here's where it gets interesting:

1. Performance
    - Handle 2,800+ writes/second (normal)
    - Scale to 14,000+ writes/second (peak)
    - Keep prediction response time under 100ms

2. High Availability
    - 99.99% uptime
    - Multi-region deployment
    - Automated failover mechanisms

3. Consistency
    - Strong consistency for sales data
    - Eventual consistency for ML models
    - Cross-region data sync

4. Accuracy & Quality
    - 90%+ prediction accuracy
    - Data quality validation in pipeline
    - Model performance monitoring

5. Scalability
    - Support 5M MAU, 500K DAU with 7% YoY growth
    - Handle 365TB before archival
    - Maintain 7 years of cold storage

### Special Considerations
Here's a crucial point that's easy to miss: new businesses won't have historical data. Our ML model typically needs 3 years of data to identify patterns effectively.
We'll need an alternative strategy for these new users - something we'll address in our design.

## The Math Behind It
You might wonder why we're doing math before architecture. Here's why: these calculations drive everything from capacity planning to cost estimates.
They help us make informed decisions about infrastructure choices and validate our architecture can handle real-world load.

Let's break down our assumptions and calculations. I've documented my detailed napkin math <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lLUAAIMQCw2c60i49MN3cSfZBSAEua_9Fndl9a4Urtc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
In a real-world scenario, you'd get these numbers from your analytics team, but for our case study, I've researched industry standards to make realistic assumptions.

## Understanding User Interactions
Before diving into the technical architecture, we need to understand how different users will interact with our system.
I've created a use-case <a href="https://cdn.anfalmushtaq.com/static/imgs/blog/2024-11-01-sales-prediction-system-design/use-case-diagram.svg" target="blank">diagram</a> that maps out these interactions.
This diagram isn't just for documentation - it helps us validate that our technical requirements align with actual user needs and ensures we're not over-engineering or missing critical functionality.

## System Architecture Deep Dive
Let's get into the meat of our design. I've created a high-level architecture diagram that you can find <a href="https://cdn.anfalmushtaq.com/static/imgs/blog/2024-11-01-sales-prediction-system-design/high-level-architecture.svg" target="_blank">here</a>. Don't get overwhelmed - we'll break it down piece by piece.

## Storage Strategy
Let's start with how we handle data - it's the foundation of our system.

### Hot Storage (First 90 Days)
- Using DynamoDB for recent data with strong consistency
- Handling ~2.9K sales/hour normally, scaling to ~15K during peaks
- Why DynamoDB? It gives us the strong consistency we need for sales data
- 90-day TTL to optimize costs (DynamoDB is expensive!)

### Data Archival (90+ Days)
- DynamoDB Streams trigger archival process through Kinesis
- Data moves to S3 with lifecycle policies:
 - S3 Standard (90 days - 6 months)
 - S3 IA (6 months - 18 months)
 - Glacier (18 months - 7 years)

If you're interested in the technical details of this archival process, check out AWS's guide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/archive-data-from-amazon-dynamodb-to-amazon-s3-using-ttl-and-amazon-kinesis-integration/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## ML Pipeline: The Brain
Here's where it gets interesting. After evaluating several options, I chose Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html" target="_blank">DeepAR model</a> for our time-series forecasting. Why? It handles:
- Rolling window training with 3-year context
- Seasonal patterns (think Black Friday, holidays)
- Multiple time series (different businesses/categories)

I've documented the complete training flow in this sequence <a href="https://cdn.anfalmushtaq.com/static/imgs/blog/2024-11-01-sales-prediction-system-design/ml-training-sequence-diagram-3.svg" target="_blank">diagram</a>.

### Handling New Businesses
Remember our earlier challenge with new businesses? Here's how we solve it:
1. Business Size Bucketing: Group similar businesses together
2. Aggregate predictions based on bucket patterns
3. Fallback to naive forecasting (weekly averages) for very new businesses

For hands-on implementation details, check out this DeepAR tutorial <a href="https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/deepar_electricity/DeepAR-Electricity.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Data Flow
To tie it all together, I've created a detailed data flow <a href="https://cdn.anfalmushtaq.com/static/imgs/blog/2024-11-01-sales-prediction-system-design/data-flow-diagram.svg" target="_blank">diagram</a>. This visualizes how data moves from initial sale to final prediction, including all the processing steps in between.

## Security & Compliance Considerations
When you're handling business sales data, security isn't optional. Here's our comprehensive approach:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Cognito for user authentication
- IAM roles for service-to-service communication
- RBAC for different user types (businesses, admins, data scientists)

### Data Security
- KMS for encryption at rest
- TLS for data in transit
- PII handling compliance for sensitive business data

### API Security
- WAF rules for DDoS protection
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API key management for service access

## The Business Reality Check
Here's where we need to take off our engineering hat and think business. I've crunched the numbers, and here's what we're looking at:

### Infrastructure Costs
- Estimated monthly cost: ~155K USD
- Full breakdown available <a href="https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=35ff756bbafb8b6fdab00c243f451bb0d8ea4d88" target="_blank">here</a>
- Includes replication costs and buffer for services like Route53

### Cost Per User
- Breaking even would require ~$32.25/user/month
- And that's before adding profit margins or considering other business costs
- Pretty steep for what might be just one feature in a larger product

### Cost Optimization Strategies
I've identified several ways to optimize:

Technical Optimizations:
1. Use spot/reserved instances
2. Refine lifecycle policies
3. Reconsider hot storage duration
4. Optimize batch job timing
5. Implement async predictions

Business Strategies:
1. Tiered pricing (AI vs non-AI predictions)
2. Consider using LLMs for simpler predictions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820v1" target="_blank">research link</a>)
3. Bundle with other high-value, lower-cost features
4. Selective data processing based on business categories

## System Limitations and Future Improvements
Let's be honest about our system's challenges:

1. Cost Structure
    - High infrastructure costs might limit market accessibility
    - Needs careful pricing strategy to remain competitive

2. New Business Predictions
    - Initial predictions may be less accurate
    - Requires time to build reliable historical data
    - Current solutions are workable but not perfect

3. Future Improvements
    - Explore cheaper prediction alternatives for smaller businesses
    - Investigate industry-specific prediction models
    - Consider hybrid approaches combining statistical and ML methods

## Wrapping Up: Beyond Just Design
This wasn't just another system design walkthrough. I wanted to show you how I approach designing systems that actually work in the real world. Here are the key principles I follow:

1. Start with Why
    - Question the problem before jumping to solutions
    - Understand stakeholder needs deeply
    - Validate the business impact

2. Numbers Matter
    - Base decisions on concrete calculations
    - Consider business viability alongside technical feasibility
    - Be ready to optimize when costs don't make sense

3. Think Holistically
    - Balance technical excellence with business reality
    - Consider security from the start
    - Plan for edge cases (like new businesses)

## What's Next?
I'm constantly evolving my approach to system design, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Have you tackled similar challenges differently? Found better ways to optimize costs? Drop me a line at hello@anfalmushtaq.com.

Remember: no system is perfect - it's all about making informed trade-offs. The key is understanding why you're making each decision and being ready to adapt as requirements change.
