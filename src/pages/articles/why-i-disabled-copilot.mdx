## Why I Partially Disabled Copilot
I have to confess. I have not disabled the copilot completely. I have reassigned it to a specific keybinding in my editor. This will allow me to still leverage the copilot, but I will deliberately choose to use it instead of getting its automatic suggestions all the time.

## Why Did I Do It?
I have been using Copilot for over a year now. Don't get me wrong; I recognize its utility. It has helped me write code faster and saved me a lot of time.

But I have noticed that it has made me lazy. I have stopped thinking deeply about the code I am writing. I know what's been written, and I understand the logic behind it, but if you have tried writing code, you will understand that every keystroke matters.
As a developer, it is my job to think deeply and make deliberate choices when writing code.

Every excellent developer I’ve met during my professional experience has one thing in common: They think deeply about the code they write and understand what it does.
It's like comparing a developer who only learned one framework of a specific language to a developer who knows the language inside out and can create a complicated and scalable system from scratch.

The latter is more likely to be a stronger developer. I would compare this to the difference between a technician and an engineer. There is nothing wrong with being a technician, and if that's what you want, go for it. But I see myself as an engineer, not just a technician.

I want to be the latter. If Copilot had done everything for me, I would never have learned anything new, and my abilities would have stagnated and deteriorated over time.
It's a well-known phenomenon in cognitive science that humans tend to forget skills or knowledge they don't regularly use, often called "decay theory."
Just as muscles weaken without exercise, cognitive skills like analytical and algorithmic thinking require continuous practice to stay sharp.
Regular reinforcement is necessary to prevent these abilities from fading and to maintain high-level performance.

Furthermore, I am looking to massively upscale my engineering skills, i.e. coding, system design and behavioural skills.
One essential skill for becoming a better developer is being able to solve problems by putting algorithms on a whiteboard, without relying on type checks, error lookups, or intellisense.
It's pure, deep analytical thinking with a pinch of dry-running capability.

Why it's essential to learn how to put an algorithm on a whiteboard is an entirely different topic, so I'll digress from that for now.
Just understand that my goal is to have a command of one programming language as I do of my native human language.
I should be able to use it with extreme precision, without relying on a "tutor" correcting me or giving me hints every two seconds (I have chosen Python, by the way).

## Why not disable it altogether?
I have considered it, but I have decided to keep it around. It's a great tool when doing a repetitive task like creating data—it's an automation tool, after all. But I will use it deliberately and not let it take over my thought process.
The goal is to look at the suggestions, understand why it's suggesting that, and then implement every line of code myself.

This way, I will still be able to leverage the copilot's suggestions and keep my analytical thinking sharp. Each time I use it, it will be a deliberate, conscious choice.
