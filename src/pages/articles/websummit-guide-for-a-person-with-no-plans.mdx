## How it all started
It all began with an Ad that I saw for WebSummit 2025. I had heard of the event before but I didn't know much about it. When I saw it was happening
in Vancouver, I was intrigued. So naturally, I looked into it and asked around to some of my friends. I was told that it's a great event to attend if you are
in the SAAS industry and a great place to network. That sold the concept to me. I was 70% sure I was going to go.

Then a few days after, one of my other friends reached out and told me she was selling her Alpha Pass for $300. I knew I wanted to go and the Pass
wasn't too expensive so I bought it from her. There was no backing out now. Whether I wanted to or not, I was going to go. 

## The problem
Even though I knew I was going, I had absolutely no idea what to expect, how to maximize my exprience, what to do or how to approach it.

## Pre-conference preparation
Just for your information, you don't completely go blank when you attend the Summit. They release their official app where you sign up and you are able
to see the schedule, speakers, events, etc. You can also see the list of attendees and what they are working on.

If you are not lazy like me, you will probably find a very good way to skim through the list, find who you'd like to meet and reach out to them before
the conference.

Naturally, I did not bother to do that as I was a) lazy and b) utterly clueless on what even was my goal to attend the conference. You can only reach out
to people if you already have a goal in mind. You don't randomly reach out to people because that's a diluted signal that goes nowhere.

## Looks matter
Just because you don't have a clue on why you are going to the conference, does not mean you have to look like an average Joe. What was going to happen their
was out of my control but what I could control was my appearance. I had to look sharp. I had to look like a professional. I had to look like I knew what I was doing (even though I didn't).

I chose to wear clothes that made me look professional and not a typical tech bro. I ditched my loving backpack and only carried small valuables to look lean and sharp. 

## Fake it till you make it
I had my Linkedin QR code ready along with a few theories on what I was going to say when people will ask me "What I was building" or "What I do for work". They were so generic that if I told you right now, you'd point out
10 different platforms that do the same thing right now. It was so abstract that the first few people I talked to, I took more than 5 minutes just to explain what I was building while jumping numerous mind hoops. 

I was constantly observing how they reacted to my pitch. Initially I saw a lot of confusion and lack of interest but I kept on fine-tuning during the entire conference to the point I was able to answer both questions
within 30 seconds to both technical and non-technical people.

## The summit begins

### Day 1
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/day-1-registration.jpg' alt="Day 1 Registration" />

May 27th was the first day of the summit. I readied myself and went to the venue. I did not know what to expect so I was just going with the flow and get the lay of the land.
Once I was registered, I headed straight to the western building where the exhibition hall was located. It turned out, today was the opening day. The only event that was supposed to happen
was at 5 PM. I was going to attend the AI innovation event at AWS' office that evening and I had 7 hours to kill. I had a choice. I could either go back to my home and come back later or
I could explore, warm myself up and start connecting with people (I am an introvert so I need a lot of time to warm up). I chose the latter.

I won't say it was easy. I was standing in the square for 7 hours straight looking for people to talk to. Success rate was really low but I was persistent. I wasn't trying to sell them anything.
I was just trying to connect with people.

**AI Innovation Event**

It was a great event. I ended up connecting with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soyoung-lee-1801a0120/" target="_blank">Soyoung Lee</a> who is the co-founder of Twelve Labs
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/1vnzh/" target="_blank">Ivan Zhang</a> who is the co-founder of Cohere.

I met quite a few old faces there as well. People I worked with in the past.

### Day 2, the fun begins
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/day-2-1.jpg' alt="Day 2" />

First order of business was to go directly to the exhibition floor. 

<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/day-2-2.jpg' alt="Day 2" />

It was a big floor and I was quite confused on where to start. I decided to randomly skim the hall once then pick up one corner
and go breadth first from one end to the other. It took me roughly 2 hours to go through the entire hall while talking to founders and their products. I kept my attention mainly on the alphas because that's
where I found the emerging products. Although, some of the betas were amazing too.

At around 5 PM, everyone started heading to Yaletown for the night summit. I walked there as well hoping to network some more but quite honestly, I did not find a lot of value in it.
People were tired, and hungry. They were winding down and ordering food. I spent roughly 30 mins there and then headed back to my home.

### Day 3, the fun continues
Thursday was a bit different and special. I not only attended the summit but all the Pakistani founders who participated in the summit were invited to the Pakistani Consulate in Vancouver.

<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/pakistan-consulate.jpeg' alt="Pakistan Consulate" />

After the meetup at the consulate was done, I headed straight back to the summit and continued the mission of networking with people. I prioritized attending the meetups and networking over exhibitions but I was still able to cover the entire hall again.
One thing you have to keep in mind is startups in the exhibition hall change every day. You will need to cover the hall every day if you are looking to get a full picture.

Night summit for this evening was in North Vancouver. Given yesterday's experience and the fact that I would've had to take a seabus to get there, I skipped it.

### Day 4, the end of the summit
Friday was a bit laxed as compared to the previous days. There weren't a lot of people in the building. Previous 2 days were jam packed. There were still quite a few people there but not as many.
I continued my exploration and the tradition of prioritizing meetups and exploring exhibitions. I was able to wrap up everything by 4 PM and head back home.

## Main lessons
### 1. Improve on the fly
Whether you know what you are doing or not, constantly monitor each word you say and how it is received. People give clues, through their body language and facial expressions.
When I was talking to people in the beginning, I noticed people would just nod and smile and in the end they'd just walk away. They didn't show any interest in what I was saying.
Some of them started looking at their phones or in the distance signalling lack of interest. I was constantly monitoring my pitch and how it was received.

I kept on fine-tuning my pitch and by the second day, I was not only able to pitch my ideas in 30 seconds or less, I was doing it in crowded areas with lots of noise. People were asking me questions
and a few them even asked me whether they could use my product.

The tip here is to keep on practicing, repeating and fine-tuning your pitch. Notice the cues and just simple words. Usual meetups were very small. You'll be talking in a group of 3-5 people while 
introducing yourself so you'll have less than 30 seconds in a noisy environment. Many people mistook "vibe coding" for "white coding" and they were so confused on what I was talking about. I changed it to
"AI generated apps" and that worked.

### 2. Keep an eye on your surroundings
I noticed quite a few data sources that could be food for thought for you. These were crowd sourced data points and if I wasn't paying closed attention, I would probably missed them.

Check out the 2 potential data points:
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/data-point-1.jpg' alt="Data point 1" />
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/data-point-2.jpg' alt="Data point 2" />

Now, I agree that this data is crowd sourced and may involve human emotion and a lot of noise but as a good founder, you may be able to find some insights from it that you can use to improve your product.

### 3. Tell a short story through your logo and headline
I walked through the exhibition hall multiple times everyday and talked to numerous founders. I talked to startups in IOT, legal tech, AI, Medical tech, and more.
I am by no means an expert of all of these domains so it's not like I saw their billboards and I immediately understood what they were building. It was so bad that sometimes, the pitch said something else
and when I talked to the founders, they told me something else.

The only ones I could understand were the ones that had a short 2 liner headline with a logo that clearly stated what they were building without any buzzwords. People are busy, they are not going to literally stand on your
booth and read your entire pitch or the cool new tech you are using. Investors and executives are going to skim through the booths while they are walking by. If you are not able to hook them in,
you may as well not even exist.

I also recommend that you watch this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4iY1ddf2Vg" target="_blank">Smith & Diction</a>.

### 4. Make product pamphlets
Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture for this one but there were quite a few founders who had printed out pamphlets for their products and whenever they were going in a meetup, they would spread them out on the table.
I thought it was clever marketing and free exposure. 

### 5. Add value
Just because you are attending a conference does not mean you cannot add value to the event. I talked to almost all the startups on the exhibition floor and networked so much that I was a walking encyclopedia of who was doing what.
If I heard a pitch that sounded familiar with someone else's work and I knew the founders could benefit with the connection, I would introduce them to each other. I was ended up helping 10+ founders match with the right people and investors.

I am not saying you should do this in this exact fashion. Find a way to add value to the event and the people around you.

### 6. Network network network
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/networking-calendar.png' alt="Networking Calendar" />

This is what my networking calendar looked like for the Summit. I was attending back to back meetups. I did not care whether it was a meetup for 
veterinary doctors, lawyers, or even the ones that were building AI tools. I was there to network and I was there to add value. It actually helped me tremendously
as well. Knowing how other domains operate and learning from experts and leaders from other industries is a great way to expand your horizon. You end up learning things
that you can apply to your own domain. I became so good at it that I was able to hold a conversation with everyone from a media person to a Medical Doctor.

** Go deep, not wide**
You typically have 20 minutes per meetup. You can choose to talk to 10 people or 1 person for 20 minutes. There is no set formula here. Follow your instincts and if you feel 
like the conversation is going well, prefer going deeper. Otherwise, feel free to move on to the next person.

On that same note, don't start fishing for leads. Keep an open mind, help others and you'll be surprised at the connections you'll make. I personally observed how closed off people
were when I mentioned "I'll help you with my knowledge". They immediately assumed I was trying to sell them something. I shifted my approach and started adding "for free" and suddenly
more people were willing to talk to me. Of course, your time is precious and you should not wholesale it so be critical of what's in it for you. I build products for non-technical people so
talking and giving advice for free is a no-brainer for me.

### 7. Retro everyday
I met people from all walks of life. Some of them were window shoppers and they just wanted to chat and some of them were potential leads. I made a google sheet where I tracked
every person I met and connected with. Filtered it down to who needs my help, who I can help and who can be a potential partner. Once the WebSummit was over, I sent a warm message to all of them
and I will catch up with them very soon. Signals decay fast. Stay on top of it.

### 8. Skip the sessions
Every session was 1 hour+ long. You can do so much more in that time and make meaningful connections. The speakers have to keep things generic and surface level in these sessions
to make sure their knowledge can be applied to everyone. In my personal experience, if you don't have a super specific usecase in mind that you want more insights on, it's not worth risking it.

This sentiment was further echoed by quite a few people I met during the summit. Decide for yourself but my advice is to skip the sessions and focus on the networking.

### 9. Don't over optimize and go with the flow
I am an introvert person who deals with neuro-divergency. I am over optimize everything. Every single detail has to fit like a piece of the puzzle for me. I was over thinking the simplest of details
like how will I know who to talk to, what to say or how to even find the relevant people. I wanted to predict the future. This is a silly mistake which unfortunately cannot be remedied for me due to my neuro-divergency,
but my advice to you is to go with the flow. Have a general plan, an abstract idea but don't stress over it. Let the universe guide you.

### 10. Use all channels available to you
Many meetups had supporting WhatsApp groups. I joined all of them and broadcasted my presence and how I can help and add value. It helped me quite a lot. If you are someone who is looking to
network for whatever reason, use all channels available to you. WhatsApp had a big advantage since my number was immediately accessible to everyone and quite a few people connected with me and 
turned into meaningful long term connections.

### Fun fact
I walked 30+ km in 4 days. I was walking for 9+ hours straight everyday. It was a stop and go strategy otherwise I am sure I could've done 50+ km.

## Conclusion
<BlogImage src='blog/2025-05-30-websummit-2025/conclusion.jpg' alt="Conclusion" />

These past 4 days were great. I started with doubts and discouragement and ended up doing so much that I am sad it's over now. One thing is for sure though. 
I am eagerly looking forward to the next one. I am going to be more prepared, confident and intentional. Until next time.
